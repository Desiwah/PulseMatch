# üìú Privacy Policy for PulseMatch

**Effective Date:** July 8, 2025

PulseMatch is a Discord bot that allows users to discover which games they share with others by linking their Steam libraries and adding optional custom (non-Steam) games. Your privacy is important to us, and this policy explains what data we collect, how it's used, and your rights regarding that data.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

When you interact with the PulseMatch bot, the following data may be collected:

- **Discord User ID** ‚Äì used to associate your data with your Discord account.
- **Steam ID** ‚Äì collected when you link your Steam account using the `/link` command.
- **Steam Game Library** ‚Äì collected **only** when you run the `/refresh` command manually.
- **Custom Games** ‚Äì any non-Steam games you add with the `/add` command.
- **Game Names Queried via RAWG** ‚Äì used for autocomplete suggestions and cached locally.

We do **not** collect:
- Your Discord messages, emails, IP address, or location.
- Any private Steam data not explicitly made public by you.

---

## 2. How Your Data Is Used

Your data is used exclusively to provide the bot‚Äôs features, including:

- Showing shared games between users.
- Listing which users own a specific game.
- Providing game name suggestions via autocomplete.
- Allowing you to manage your own game list.

We **do not** use your data for analytics, advertising, or profiling.  
We **do not** share your data with third parties.

Your Steam library is **only fetched manually when you use the `/refresh` command**. It is stored locally and **never automatically updated or polled repeatedly**. The bot does **not spam or abuse Steam‚Äôs API**.

---

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

All user data is stored **securely on a rented server** used to host the bot.  
Data is saved in private, local databases that are **not accessible to the public** and are only used by the bot for its features.  
No user data is sent to or stored on any third-party analytics or cloud services.

Each user is responsible for managing their own data. You may delete **all of your stored data** at any time by using the `/unlink` command.

The bot developer **cannot delete data on your behalf**. Doing so manually would corrupt the database and break functionality for other users. The bot is intentionally designed so that users must manage and delete their own data via bot commands.

---

## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do **not** share, sell, or disclose your data to any third parties.  
The data is only accessible to the bot developer for the purpose of operating and maintaining the bot.

We are not affiliated with Discord, Valve (Steam), or RAWG. Use of their services is governed by their own privacy policies.

---

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

As a user, you have full control over your data:

- You may link or unlink your Steam account at any time.
- You may add or remove custom game entries.
- You may delete **all stored data** at any time by using the `/unlink` command.
- You are free not to use the bot at all if you do not wish to share any information.

## 6. Children‚Äôs Privacy

PulseMatch is intended only for users who meet the **minimum age requirement set by Discord‚Äôs Terms of Service**.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under that age.  
If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the bot, you may request data deletion by instructing them to run the `/unlink` command.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally.  
If changes are made, the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù at the top will be updated.  
Your continued use of the bot after changes are posted means you accept the revised policy.
