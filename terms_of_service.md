**Effective Date:** July 8, 2025

## 1. Purpose

PulseMatch is a Discord bot designed to help users identify shared games with other Discord members by linking Steam libraries and adding optional custom game entries.

## 2. Acceptable Use

By using this bot, you agree to:

- Use the bot only for its intended purpose.
- Not use the bot to harass, abuse, spam, or harm other users.
- Not attempt to reverse-engineer, clone, exploit, or disrupt the bot‚Äôs functionality.
- Not impersonate others or use misleading information when linking accounts.

You are responsible for your behavior while using the bot, and any misuse may result in access being restricted or blocked.

## 3. Data Usage and Consent

By using commands such as `/link`, `/refresh`, `/add`, and others, you acknowledge and consent to the storage and handling of the following information:

## 4. Data Management Responsibility

You are solely responsible for managing and deleting your data through the bot. The `/unlink` command allows you to delete all your stored data.

The bot developer **cannot delete your data on your behalf**. Manual deletion could corrupt the database and cause errors for other users, so the bot is designed for users to manage their own data directly.

## 5. Availability and Reliability

PulseMatch is provided **‚Äúas is‚Äù** with no guarantees of uptime, performance, or uninterrupted availability. The developer may update, modify, or remove features at any time without notice.

- Any damage, loss, or disruption resulting from the use (or inability to use) the bot.

Use of the bot implies understanding and acceptance of these risks.

## 7. External Services

PulseMatch uses data from external platforms such as:

- **Steam (Valve Corporation)**
- **RAWG Video Game Database**

These platforms have their own terms and privacy policies. PulseMatch is not affiliated with them.

## 8. Changes to These Terms

These Terms of Service may be updated occasionally.  
If changes are made, the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù at the top will be updated.  
By continuing to use the bot after changes are posted, you agree to the revised terms.
