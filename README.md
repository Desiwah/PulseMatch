<h1 align="center">PulseMatch Discord Bot</h1>

<p align="center"><b>PulseMatch</b> makes game nights effortless by showing which Steam games you and your friends share.  
You can instantly see who owns what or create a post with <code>/post</code> to find teammates right away.</p>

&nbsp;

# **Overview**

üéÆ **Instant game checks**  
See all the games you share with a friend or find who owns a specific title.

ü§ù **Find teammates with `/post`**  
Create a public post for any game. Friends can mark interest, you get notified, and posts expire after 24 hours.

‚ûï **Non-Steam games supported**  
Add titles like Minecraft or Valorant manually. They work the same as Steam games in comparisons and posts.

üîî **Smart notifications**  
Enable alerts and get a DM when someone joins your play request. No spam, just the signals that matter.

üì¨ **DM results**  
Long lists are sent to your DMs with page buttons for easy browsing.

üõ°Ô∏è **Private and simple**  
No Steam login required. Just link your profile, refresh your library, and you're done.  
Your data stays local to the bot.

&nbsp;

# **Instructions**

After you `/link` your Steam, just run `/refresh` to update your game library and you're good to go!

*You only need to `/refresh` again after buying a new Steam game.*
*For non-Steam titles, use `/add` instead.*
*This ensures the game shows up the next time you or someone else uses `/run_game` or `/run_user`.*

&nbsp;

‚ö†Ô∏è Your **Steam profile** and **game details** must be set to public for Steam library comparison features (`/run_game`, `/run_user` and `/refresh`).

Custom games added with `/add` are not affected by Steam privacy settings.

If you prefer to keep them private, you can switch back **after** running the `/refresh` command.
