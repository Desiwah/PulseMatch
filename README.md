<h1 align="center">PulseMatch Discord Bot</h1>

<p align="center"><b>PulseMatch</b> makes game nights effortless by showing which Steam games you and your friends share.  
You can instantly see who owns what or create a post with <code>/post</code> to find teammates right away.</p>

&nbsp;

# **Overview**

🎮 **Instant game checks**  
See all the games you share with a friend or find who owns a specific title.

🤝 **Find teammates with `/post`**  
Create a public post for any game. Friends can mark interest, you get notified, and posts expire after 24 hours.

➕ **Non-Steam games supported**  
Add titles like Minecraft or Valorant manually. They work the same as Steam games in comparisons and posts.

🔔 **Smart notifications**  
Enable alerts and get a DM when someone joins your play request. No spam, just the signals that matter.

📬 **DM results**  
Long lists are sent to your DMs with page buttons for easy browsing.

🛡️ **Private and simple**  
No Steam login required. Just link your profile, refresh your library, and you're done.  
Your data stays local to the bot.

&nbsp;

# **Instructions**

1.  `/link <Steam profile URL>` your Steam profile URL.
2.  `/refresh` your library.
3.  Done!

&nbsp;

⚠️ **BEFORE REFRESHING (Important):**

For the bot to see your games, your **Steam Privacy Settings** must be set to:

* **My Profile** | *Public*
* **Game Details** | *Public*
* **Always keep my total playtime private** | *UNCHECKED*

📍 **Navigation:** `[USERNAME]` > `Profile` > `Edit Profile` > `Privacy Settings`

&nbsp;

> [!TIP]
> You can switch these back to *Private* after the `/refresh`.
