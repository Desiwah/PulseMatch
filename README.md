# PulseMatch Discord Bot

Use the **PulseMatch** bot to discover which Steam games you share with others or find out who else owns a specific game you have.

&nbsp;

‚ö†Ô∏è Your **Steam profile** and **game details** must be set to public, otherwise the bot won't work!
If you prefer to keep your Steam profile and game details private, you can switch them back **after** running the `/refresh` command.

&nbsp;

After you `/link` your Steam, just `/refresh` to update your game library and you're good to go!
(You only need to `/refresh` again after buying a new game, so it's included the next time you or someone else uses the `/run` command)

&nbsp;

**Commands:**

`/link` *<Steam ID or URL>* - Link your Steam account

`/refresh` - Update your Steam library

`/add` *<game>* - Add a custom (non-Steam) game

`/remove` *<game>* - Remove a custom game

`/run_game` *<game>* - See who owns a game

`/run_user` *<@user>* - View shared games with a user

`/unlink` - Delete all your data from the bot's server
