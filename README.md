# PulseMatch Discord Bot

**PulseMatch** makes game nights effortless by showing which Steam games you and your friends share.  
You can instantly see who owns what or create a post with `/post` to find teammates right away.

&nbsp;

🎮 **Instant game checks**  
See all the games you share with a friend or find who owns a specific title.

🤝 **Find teammates with `/post`**  
Create a public post for any game. Friends can mark interest, you get notified, and posts expire after 24 hours.

➕ **Non-Steam games supported**  
Add titles like Minecraft or Valorant manually. They work the same as Steam games in comparisons and posts.

🔔 **Smart notifications**  
Enable alerts and get a DM when someone joins your play request. No spam, just the signals that matter.

📬 **DM results**  
Long lists are sent to your DMs with page buttons for easy browsing.

🛡️ **Private and simple**  
No Steam login required. Just link your profile, refresh your library, and you're done.  
Your data stays local to the bot.

&nbsp;

# **Instructions:**

After you `/link` your Steam, just run `/refresh` to update your game library and you're good to go!  

(You only need to `/refresh` again after buying a new game, so it’s included the next time you or someone else uses `/run_game`, `/run_user` or `/post`.)  

&nbsp;

⚠️ Your **Steam profile** and **game details** must be set to public, otherwise library comparison features will not work.  
If you prefer to keep them private, you can switch back **after** running the `/refresh` command.  

&nbsp;

# **Commands:**

`/link <Steam ID or URL>` - Link your Steam account

`/refresh` - Update your Steam library

`/add <game>` - Add a custom (non-Steam) game

`/remove <game>` - Remove a custom game

`/run_game <game>` - See who owns a game

`/run_user <@user>` - View shared games with a user

`/post <game>` - Post a public request to find players for a game

`/unlink` - Delete all your data from the bot's server
